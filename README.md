## Description:
Third project of The Odin Project. This project is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game played in the console. This project displays basic JavaScript skills from variables to functions.

## Skills:
This project was a good way to practice the basic JavaScript skills that I learned and to further hammer in the syntax. It was not the most challenging project, but still allowed me to practice the basics of JavaScript.

## Reflection: 
This project was not super difficult, but I also have prior experience using other programming languages. I enjoyed doing this though as it was useful to help remember the syntax and practice a bit of clean code.
