## Description:
Third project of The Odin Project. This project is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. This project displays basic JavaScript skills from variables to functions and DOM manipulation.

## Skills:
This project was a good way to practice the basic JavaScript skills that I learned and to further hammer in the syntax. It was not the most challenging project, but still allowed me to practice the basics of JavaScript. IT also allowed me to practice DOM manipulation and events. 

## Reflection: 
This project was not super difficult, but I also have prior experience using other programming languages. I enjoyed doing this though as it was useful to help remember the syntax and practice a bit of clean code.
